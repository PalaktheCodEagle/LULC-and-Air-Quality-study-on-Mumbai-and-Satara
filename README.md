# 🌍 Transforming Landscapes: Impact of LULC on Air Quality

## 🔍 Overview

This project explores the relationship between **Land Use Land Cover (LULC)** patterns and **Air Quality** across two contrasting regions in Maharashtra — Mumbai and Satara. It uses remote sensing and machine learning to classify land use, predict future air quality trends, and assess potential health risks using explainable AI.

The project combines data from **Landsat-8/9**, **Sentinel-5P**, and government sources, integrating spatial-temporal models to support sustainable urban planning and public health insights.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Classify LULC in Mumbai and Satara using satellite data
- Predict future LULC trends using QGIS and AI models
- Forecast AQI (Air Quality Index) levels from 2017–2035 using GRU+GCN
- Interpret the role of LULC and pollutants on AQI using SHAP and LIME
- Predict diphtheria risk using Composite Kernel Gaussian Process Regression
